#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing ,and maintenance of software . Its importance in the technology industry are :it ensures development of high quality software , improves efficiency , it reduces software development costs and time , it enhances security and reliability of software systems. 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of software development - Early software was develped manually with no structured methodology. programs were written in machine langauge and assembly . structured programming - this is the introduction of structured programming langauges like C. Agile and DevOps and cloud computing have transformed software development emphasizing collaboration and faster delivery . 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project goals, scope, and feasibility.
	•	Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs and system requirements.
	•	Design – Create architecture, system models, and UI/UX designs.
	•	Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code for the software.
	•	Testing – Detect and fix bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
	•	Deployment – Release the software to users.
	•	Maintenance – Provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•	Waterfall Methodology:
	•	Follows a linear, sequential approach.
	•	Each phase is completed before the next begins.
	•	Best for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government software.
	•	Agile Methodology:
	•	Uses an iterative and flexible approach.
	•	Development is done in small increments (sprints).
	•	Ideal for dynamic projects, like mobile app development, where requirements frequently change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
•	Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and debugs software.
	•	Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software to find and report bugs, ensures software meets quality standards.
	•	Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, manages resources, and ensures software is delivered on time and within budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•	IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
	•	Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
	•	Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
	•	Version Control Systems (VCS):
	•	Track changes in code, facilitate collaboration.
	•	Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•	Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes – Software engineers must continuously learn through online courses, tech blogs, and industry conferences.
	•	Managing Complex Codebases – Using modular programming, clean coding practices, and proper documentation can simplify maintenance.
	•	Debugging and Troubleshooting – Employing debugging tools, logging frameworks, and automated testing can make issue resolution easier.
	•	Meeting Project Deadlines – Effective project management techniques, Agile methodologies, and time management tools help teams stay on track.
	•	Security Vulnerabilities – Implementing security best practices like encryption, authentication, and regular code audits can reduce risks.
	•	Collaboration and Communication Issues – Using collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira, GitHub) and clear documentation improves teamwork.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•	Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly. It helps catch bugs early in development.
	•	Integration Testing – Verifies that different modules or services work together as expected. It prevents issues caused by component interactions.
	•	System Testing – Tests the complete software system to ensure it meets requirements and works in a real-world environment.
	•	Acceptance Testing – Performed by users or stakeholders to ensure the software meets business needs before deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective input prompts to optimize AI model responses. It involves structuring queries in a way that guides the AI to generate useful and accurate outputs.

Importance:
	•	Improves the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.
	•	Enhances user interaction with AI-powered applications.
	•	Helps in automating complex tasks by refining prompts for better efficiency.
	•	Enables better control over AI-generated content in chatbots, coding assistants, and other AI tools.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
•	Vague Prompt: “Tell me about AI.”
	•	Improved Prompt: “Explain the key applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare, including examples of AI-powered medical diagnostics and patient monitoring.”

Why is the improved prompt more effective?
	•	It clearly defines the topic (AI in healthcare).
	•	It specifies the type of information needed (applications, examples).
	•	It ensures a more detailed and relevant response rather than a broad, generic answer.
